# Hunger_bridge
Bridging Hunger with Humanity: An Open-Source Platform to Save Surplus Food and Feed Lives  Every day, wedding halls, mandaps, banquet venues, and caterers prepare more food than gets consumed. At the same time, orphanages, shelters, and NGOs struggle to provide daily meals. 🛠️ Built with love, not for profit — but for purpose.
